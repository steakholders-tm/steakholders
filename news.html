            <h2>App soon ready for launch</h2>

                The server and its API is completed, the views for the app and most of its functionality is in place.
                now all we need is some final touches and make it work properly!

            <h2>App now in development</h2>
            <p>
                After some minor changes to the architecture and pattern decitions, the development has begun.
                The first views for the app has been created and the API for the server is in the planning. Hopefully
                there will soon be Bingo for us all.

            <h2>Archtectural sketch completed</h2>
            <p>
                A draft of the complete architecture for the game has been created. It will be a client-server
                architecture with a client android app, and a dedicated server which handles most of the logic. Further
                on the client will be using MVC.

            <h2>BINGO!</h2>
            <p>
                Well... yeh. Literally. We got Bingo. Our app idea that is. We are going to make a bingo app based
                on classroom bingo, but with the possibility to expand it to other types of bingo. <br>

            <h2>Brainstorming game ideas</h2>
            <p>
                Even though an awardwinning, milliondollar game idea would be great, the main goal is to
                creat and learn about system architectures. Thus the game should allow for use of muliple patterns
                and preferably patterns which are widely used and documented.
